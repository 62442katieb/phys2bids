Phys2bids is a python3 library meant to format physiological files in BIDS.
It was born for AcqKnowledge files (BIOPAC), and at the moment it supports
``.acq`` files as well as ``.txt`` files obtained by labchart
(ADInstruments).
It doesn't support physiological files recorded with the MRI, as you can find a software for it [here](https://github.com/tarrlab/physio2bids).

**The project is currently under development**.
Any suggestion/bug report is welcome! Feel free to open an issue.
